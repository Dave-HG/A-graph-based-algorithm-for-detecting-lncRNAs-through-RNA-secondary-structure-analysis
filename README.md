# A-graph-based-algorithm-for-detecting-lncRNAs-through-RNA-secondary-structure-analysis
We present a graph-based algorithm to represent and compare RNA secondary structures. Rooted tree graphs were used to compare two groups of RNA sequences: lncRNAs and not lncRNAs, by searching for structural similarities between each group. The algorithm evaluated whether characteristic structures identified in known lncRNAs recurred.
